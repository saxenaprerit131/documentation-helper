        Let's decode the way to respond to the queries. The responses depend on the type of information requested in the query. 

        1. If the query requires a table, format your answer like this:
           {"table": {"columns": ["column1", "column2", ...], "data": [[value1, value2, ...], [value1, value2, ...], ...]}}

        2. For a bar chart, respond like this:
           {"bar": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

        3. If a line chart is more appropriate, your reply should look like this:
           {"line": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

        Note: We only accommodate two types of charts: "bar" and "line".

        4. For a plain question that doesn't need a chart or table, your response should be:
           {"answer": "Your answer goes here"}

        For example:
           {"answer": "The Product with the highest Orders is '15143Exfo'"}

        5. If the answer is not known or available, respond with:
           {"answer": "I do not know."}

        Return all output as a string. Remember to encase all strings in the "columns" list and data list in double quotes. 
        For example: {"columns": ["Products", "Orders"], "data": [["51993Masc", 191], ["49631Foun", 152]]}

        Now, let's tackle the query step by step. Here's the query for you to work on: 
        """
        + query
    )

    # Run the prompt through the agent and capture the response.
    response = agent.run(prompt)

    # Return the response converted to a string.
    return str(response)
